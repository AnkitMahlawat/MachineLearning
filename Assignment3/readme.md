# Problem Statement

Apply the logistic regression and neural network classifier (with single hidden layer) on live dataset provided in assignment 2. Also try to tune the parameters for each model and compare all the models including SVR for the given regression problem.

You are required to convert the dataset into a fixed length vector format. You may use cropping, padding, clustering and histogram etc. You can split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing. You are also required to report the mean output score for test data over 10 runs of the experiment. Further, you may use 5-fold cross-validation for tuning the various parameters with grid search.
