# Problem Statement
### Image Reconstruction , Image Quality Assessment :
you will be give a Image data set of size (256 by 256). These (256 by 256) images are created from (512 by 512) size images by first removing alternate columns from Image matrix which creates a image of size (512 by 256) Now alternate rows are removed from this image matrix which gives us (256 by 256) images . Create a model which , given this images (i.e. 256 by 256) , performs reconstruction these images to (512 by 512) size images. your Image quality will be calculate by PSNR value.
